# Loanword status

This category is manifested in nouns, adjectives and verbs - all lexemes are
classified in one of two broad groups:

  - marked as inherited (oikoclitic)
  - marked as a loanword (xenoclitic)


# Nouns

Apart from the loanword status, nouns are classified along two major axes:

  - gender: [masculine]{#M} -- [feminine]{#F}
  - animacy: [animate]{#ANIM} -- [inanimate]{#INANIM}


## Subgroups

Inherited nouns have mostly either [vocalic]{#VOC} NOM.SG ending, or zero NOM.SG (end in a [consonant]{#CONS}).

A large group of inherited feminine nouns [add /j/]{#J} to the vocalic stem.
