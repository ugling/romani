# Loanword status

This category is manifested in nouns, verbs and possibly adjectives - all lexemes are
classified to one of two broad groups:

  - marked as inherited (oikoclitic)
  - marked as a loanword (xenoclitic)

Actual loanwords may lack the loanword marking (o drom "way").


# Nouns

Apart from the loanword status, nouns are classified along two major axes:

  - gender: [masculine]{#M} -- [feminine]{#F}
  - animacy: [animate]{#ANIM} -- [inanimate]{#INANIM}


## Subgroups

Inherited nouns have mostly either [vocalic]{#VOC} NOM.SG ending, or zero NOM.SG (end in a [consonant]{#CONS}).

A significant group of inherited feminine nouns [add /j/]{#J} to the vocalic stem.
